## 📜 Challenge Description

A suspicious GitHub account — **`shadowdev2024-com`** — has been discovered.  
It hosts an old repository named **`secret-project`** containing what appear to be ordinary files...  
but the **real clues** are hidden deep within its **commit history**.

Can you uncover the truth about this project and its mysterious author?
