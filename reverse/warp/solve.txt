Organizer Notes / Solve Sketch — Obelisque

- Anti-debug: ptrace(TRACEME) + /proc/self/status TracerPid. Patch to NOP or force return 0.
- Input format gate: "CYBERDUNE{" ... "}"
- Core check: vm_mix() computes two 64-bit values h0,h1 from the entire input using AES-like sbox, rotations, and a murmur-style fmix. Final condition:
    (h0 ^ h1) == expected
- expected is stored as obf_expected ^ 0xA5.. key; keys k0/k1 also obfuscated likewise.
- Recover expected by XORing obf_expected with 0xA5A5A5A5A5A5A5A5.

Reference flag used to generate expected:
    CYBERDUNE{VM_REV_HARDCORE_0xA5}

Verification:
    echo -n 'CYBERDUNE{VM_REV_HARDCORE_0xA5}' | ./obelisque

Suggested reversing route:
    1) Neutralize anti-debug.
    2) Extract sbox and vm_mix; reimplement in Python.
    3) Since vm_mix is deterministic and robustly mixing, brute-forcing is not feasible; instead, note we already know format and can search by guided constraint (not needed here for organizers).
    4) Alternatively, read constants obf_expected/k0/k1, undo XOR 0xA5.. and compute vm_mix(flag) to check.
