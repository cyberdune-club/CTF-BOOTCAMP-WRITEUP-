Hints

Hint 1 — Observation
Open mystery.enc in a text viewer. Notice the characters — they look like hexadecimal. That’s your first clue.

Hint 2 — Direction
Try reversing the string. Something interesting happens when you undo what was flipped.

Hint 3 — Common Layers
CTF-style encodings often chain together hex → base64 → compression. Think step by step — decode, then decompress.
